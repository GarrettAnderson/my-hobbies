      <h1>Let Me Tell You About the Violin</h1>
      <p>
        I started playing the violin when I was 10. I was first interested in playing when I listened to Mozart and
        Vivaldi. Although, classical music is my first love, I would really like to learn more bluegrass and fiddle
        techniques. I have been out of practice for a while which is my first hurdle. My goal is to get into the habit
        of
        playing music every day in order to keep my finders warm and retrain my brain.
