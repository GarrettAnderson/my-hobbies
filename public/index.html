  <section>
    <p>
      I started playing the violin when I was 10. I was first interested in playing when I listened to Mozart and
      Vivaldi. Although, classical music is my first love, I would really like to learn more bluegrass and fiddle
      techniques. I have been out of practice for a while which is my first hurdle. My goal is to get into the habit of playing music every day in order to keep my finders warm and retrain my brain.
